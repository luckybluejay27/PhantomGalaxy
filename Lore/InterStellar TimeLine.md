### **Galactic Spins (GS) - Timekeeping Standard**

- **A Galactic Spin (GS) is 10 millionth of a full galactic rotation (~22.5 Terran Years).**
- **Each GS is divided into 1000 decimal Galactic Spins (dGS), where 1 dGS ≈ 8.2 Terran Days.**
- **Maintained by the International Freelance Guild & Queen of History for archival records.**
- **dGS serves as the primary unit for short-term events, navigation logs, and administration.**
- **This system ensures consistent interstellar record-keeping across factions.**
- **This root log only covers fundamental shifts in power, or major relational changes between factions, even if minor events change such trajectories**

## **741 GS: War Of Intelligence**

- The Tannon, long viewing the Juvians as an inferior species due to their cooperative, non-hierarchical culture, declare war after what they perceive as a weak response to territorial occupation.
- The Tannon believe that true strength is demonstrated through endurance, conquest, and structured dominance, viewing Juvian reliance on mutualism and knowledge-sharing as signs of fundamental weakness.
- The Terran Federation, bound by the Treaty of Unity, steps in to defend Juvia, leading to accusations of cowardice from the Tannon, who see Terrans as dishonorably shielding a lesser species from the natural order of conflict.
- **Landmark Battle of Voshtal Rift (741 GS 400 dGS)**: The battle ends in a brutal stalemate, as neither side is able to gain definitive control of the system. Terran reinforcements continue to pressure Tannon forces, while the Tannon's superior battlefield tactics prevent a complete rout. The prolonged engagement drains both factions, leading to logistical exhaustion and shifting the conflict toward strategic positioning rather than outright conquest.
- **Tannon Occupation of Hadron V (742 GS 020 dGS)**: Following the Voshtal Rift stalemate, the Tannon seize Hadron V, a strategic outpost critical for territorial expansion. The occupation threatens long-term control of the sector.
- **Archon Preemptive Glassing of Hadron V (742 GS 130 dGS)**: In an unprecedented move, the Archon Continuum intervenes with its first military strike, glassing Hadron V before it can be entrenched as a permanent Tannon foothold. The act is intended as a warning to all factions: Archon will not participate in wars, but should it be forced to act, its response will be absolute.
- The glassing cripples Tannon expansion efforts, leading to their gradual encirclement by Terran forces.
- **Final Battle of Vrothian Expanse (744 GS 300 dGS)**: With dwindling resources and limited escape routes, the Tannon are forced into submission by a concentrated Terran assault. The battle is smaller in scale but results in a clear Terran victory, forcing the Tannon leadership into a ceasefire negotiation.
- **War of Havon Prime (744 GS - 751 GS)**: Despite the military surrender, tensions between the Tannon and the Federation persist. The war ends in official terms, but the uneasy peace leads to continuous minor skirmishes and political maneuvering.

## **764 GS - The Rebel Code**

- The landmark case **Torrence v. Archon Governance** establishes that any law may be **retroactively modified, but not removed**, if it is demonstrated to result in **Inefficient Behavior**.
- The ruling solidifies Archon’s belief that **governance must be fluid and adaptable**, reinforcing their ethos that rebellion and legal challenge are **not just permissible but necessary for societal evolution**.
- To prevent authoritarian manipulation, all proposed modifications must:
  - Be **peer-reviewed** by independent councils from all four governing branches.
  - **Not override fundamental civil protections**.
  - Undergo **public scrutiny and open challenge** before enactment.
- The ruling legally codifies **rebellion as a mechanism for legal reform**, ensuring that **revolutionary action is protected if it leads to the refinement of inefficient governance structures**.

## **777 GS - Engram v. Maid Servicer S1567**

- The first recorded defection of a Maid Foundation unit seeking asylum, setting off a chain reaction that forced the legal reclassification of all sophont Maids under Archon law.
- The ruling ensured full recognition of independent thought and autonomy for all Maid units, effectively dismantling prior restrictions on their civil rights.
- This case became the most publicized legal battle in the galaxy, sparking sweeping policy changes across multiple factions, despite heavy resistance and formal complaints from TMF leadership.
- In retaliation, TMF begins withdrawing key services from Archon territories, leading to infrastructure concerns and political strain between the two factions. The Terran Federation, recognizing the potential destabilization of a major interstellar partner, steps in with additional resource allocations to mitigate immediate crises. While Terra does not formally take a stance against TMF, it strategically offers logistical and technological aid, ensuring that Archon remains operational despite TMF’s withdrawal.

## **780 GS - The Surrender of Xecgar the Annihilator**

- After the defection of a major leader head, Xecgar, the Tannon fully submit to Terran supremacy, under the condition that they still practice their eternal test, and get battle ground planets to do so.

## **780 GS 003 dGS - Treaty of Xecgar**

- After plans initiate to construct Hadron VI, a formal treaty is created between Tannon and Terran forces, to trade battle grounds for safe haven science research, under Tannon protection.

## **780 GS 009 dGS - The Occupation of Hadron Prime**

- In an attempt to assassinate current WarHead Xecgar, Tannon Dissidents surround Hadron Prime in a display of aggression, requesting the dismantling of the Treaty of Xecgar. Xecgar flees on a Juvian ship, and stays at Archon Stronghold for the time being, under agreement with Terra.
- Terrans flood the system with Destroyers, and threaten to glass Hadron Prime if dissidents don't surrender.
- **780 GS 015 dGS** defectors officially surrender. Some ships are seen fleeing the Hadron System.
