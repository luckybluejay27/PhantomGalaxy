### **Galactic Spins (GS) – Timekeeping Standard**

- **A Galactic Spin (GS) is one ten-millionth of a full galactic rotation (\~22.5 Terran Years).**
- **Each GS is divided into 1,000 decimal Galactic Spins (dGS), where 1 dGS ≈ 8.2 Terran Days.**
- **Maintained by the International Freelance Guild & the Queen of History for archival records.**
- **dGS serves as the primary unit for short-term events, navigation logs, and administration.**
- **This system ensures consistent interstellar record-keeping across factions.**
- **This root log only covers fundamental shifts in power or major relational changes between factions, even if minor events influence such trajectories.**

- **752 GS 003 dGS – DNA synthesis reveals cell-to-cell electric transmission. Terra begins research.**

**755** **GS** - **Self Proclaimed Tannons seek to declare official war on Juvia**
- Terrans surprised by Tannons knowing South Juvian Lingua
- Deliberations occur, discovery on their Eternal Test doctrine and their collective wish to consume Juvians if they do not survive the war conquest. 
- 755 gs 010 dGS - Terrans forbid conquest. Tannons send official declaration of war as a paper letter to a Terran Ambassador

**756 GS – War of Intelligence**
- Following the declaration of war, Tannons reveal the Hadron System, a base only a few light years from Juvia.
- Terrans impose a blockade around Juvia almost immediately.
- **756 GS 070 dGS – Archon glassing of Hadron V**
  - Framed as a precedent-setting act: Archon declares a universal ban on genocide.
  - Terran outrage at Archon intervention; Juvian councils side with Archon stance.
- **758 GS – Final Battle of Vrothian Expanse (outer Juvian Belt)**
  - Within a single Spin the Tannons are overextended.
  - Terran numbers overwhelm them; Tannon leaders declare cease fire.
  - Minor skirmishes (J12 front) taper off as deliberations restart.

**760 GS - Uneasy peace between Tannon and Terran forces**

**761 GS - Treaty of Xecgar**
- After years of deliberations and a host of new laws written, Tannons agree to be absorbed under Terran rule.
- Archons are requested to aid in the reinstantiation of Hadron V. 
- Tannons allowed to live either as Terran citizens, or back in the Hadron System under Terran rule.
- A famous Keeper of Flesh, Yorvax Flees to Archon Continuum. 

**764 GS – The Rebel Code**
- **Torrence v. Archon Governance**: Laws may be retroactively modified (not removed) if proven inefficient.
- Rebellion is codified as a tool for legal reform.
- Reforms must:
  - Be peer-reviewed by all four Archon branches.
  - Not override civil protections.
  - Undergo public scrutiny.

**768 GS – Yorvax publicly proclaims himself Archon of Security**
- First Tannon recognized within the Archon Continuum.
- Marks both the first Tannon Archon and the first non-native to hold an Archon office.
- The Guild acknowledges the public proclamation but records little of the preceding campaigns, as these were regional and not galactic in scope.

**770 GS – Infection Outbreak at Stellar Outpost 9**
- Venus research station overtaken by fungal growth.
- Tannon forces initiate full eradication by flame.

**777 GS – Engram v. Maid Servicer S1567**
- First defection of a Maid unit seeking asylum.

- Triplicate DNA strands with neural-like behavior discovered.
- Terra seeks international help to develop containment and communication protocols.

**782 GS 064 dGS – The Translation Threshold**
- Archon and Terran linguists co-develop a hybrid, modular language system dubbed the "Cognition Mesh," capable of self-regulating inputs across multiple modalities.
- The model maps time-layered bioelectric signal pathways to derive partial meaning. It is **flawed but functional**, offering high-fidelity **simultaneous truth structures** that remain **indiscernible to most minds** due to overwhelming semantic overlay.
- While no stable linguistic map of Nuraxite (Woven endonym) exists, **positive/negative binary intention outputs** are now reliably detectable.
- A known mass threshold of \~1 ton of interconnected fungal tissue is required to achieve consistent theory-of-mind responses.

**782 GS 064 dGS – Parallel Project: Probable Host Indexing**
- The Cognition Core develops a probabilistic model to identify viable host candidates based on psychoneural dissociation tolerance and cognitive resilience.
- A human subject—calm, emotionally flattened, and dissociative—meets the profile, with a **reduced likelihood of overfield psychosis or full personality overwrite**.
- Preparations begin for **controlled cognitive integration**, marking the first **ethically consented experimental host** in Woven research history.
# Accords Era
