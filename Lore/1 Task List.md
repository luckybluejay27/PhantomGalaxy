Wants to develop the story of the first Human-Tannon, a monolithic human female whose controlled, unbridled rage earned her rank among the Tannon. This character should embody the struggle of earning a place in Tannon society while maintaining her humanity.


**Amf Sisrick Tirk (Phantom Galaxy)**: First viable human-Juvian hybrid capable of producing offspring with both species. She has a humanoid silhouette with two arms, a smaller thorax integrated into her spine, and spinnerets on her wrists. Her chelicera function as jaws, and fused pedipalps serve as her neck and esophagus. Retains digitigrade legs augmented with human thigh muscles for strength and bulk. Features articulate, enlarged claws. Protected by a keratin carapace for natural ballistic defense; inner anatomy remains largely human. Female-presenting with mammalian features and carbon-keratin alloy hair for additional exoskeletal protection. Lacks an endoskeleton except for a reinforced spine; retains eight Juvian eyes.
