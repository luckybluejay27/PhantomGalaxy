### Tenses

The following is a table of tenses. Tenses are an additional suffix appearing after the pronoun suffix. Pick a tense, take the translation found in its adjacent cell (next in row), and add it to the word.

| Tense              | Tense Suffix |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Present Simple     | n/a          |
| Present Continuous | ka           |
| Present Perfect    | kɸ           |
| Past Simple        | ʒa           |
| Past Continuous    | ʒɸ           |
| Past Perfect       | ʒu           |
| Future Simple      | βa           |
| Future Continuous  | βɸ           |
| Future Perfect     | βu           |

Example: [irmǀika] directly translates to "I am walking."

Quantifiers and Prepositions appear prior to the noun, unless modifying a verb or succeeding noun.

Nouns are only modified via numbers or similar concepts like "many" or "none". Usually as a hyphenated prefix to the noun in question.
Nouns are never conjugated.

## Conditionals

| English| Translation |
| ------ | ----------- |
| Should | ni   |
| Would  | bri  |
| Could  | \|ri |

| Like   | ǁo   |

Conditionals modify verbs, but appear prior to the conjugated form, as a word. Much like "Should Have" in English does.
