## **Cultural Philosophy**

The Tannon are a species defined by **endurance, conquest, and structured dominance**. Their society revolves around the principle of the **Eternal Test**, which dictates that all individuals and structures must prove their worth through action, strength, and contribution. Stagnation is death, and only those who continuously strive forward are worthy of survival.

### **Core Values:**

- **Endurance Over Speed** – Strength is measured in the ability to persist, not in quick victories.
- **Dominance With Order** – Power is not chaotic; it is structured and upheld with discipline.
- **Struggle as Purification** – Those who endure hardship without breaking are the most worthy
- **Clans as Legacy** – One’s value is measured by the strength of their Warbond and Clan.

## **Interpersonal Relationships**

Tannon relationships are built upon **duty, shared struggle, and hierarchical bonds**. They do not form casual friendships as other species do. Instead, relationships are structured within their society’s framework and built upon **earned respect** rather than sentiment.
### **Warbonds (Foundational Unit of Social Life)**

- **Composed of six individuals** who live, train, and fight together
- **Loyalty is absolute**—betrayal of a Warbond is worse than death
- **Each member has a distinct role**, ensuring the efficiency of the Warbond
	- **The Pillars**
	    - **The Keeper of Flesh** – Oversees warrior recovery, battlefield medicine, and biological enhancement. Ensures no warrior is wasted through unnecessary suffering. Directs bio-experimentation on enslaved populations to improve Tannon physiology.
	    - **The Keeper of Fire** – Maintains weapon forges, armor construction, and warship maintenance. Directs fortifications and planetary infrastructure. In charge of forging "Legacy Chains"—the symbolic chains made from conquered civilizations.
	    - **The Keeper of Minds** – The most experienced war planner, second only to the Clan Warlord. Trains warriors in military doctrine, battlefield adaptability, and conquest psychology. Develops long-term war plans, ensuring conquests last beyond a single battle.
	    - **The Keeper of Order** – Oversees internal disputes, challenges for leadership, and honor codes. Manages the enslaved populations, determining their uses, punishments, and worth. Enforces The Law of the Eternal Test, ensuring weakness is punished and strength rewarded.
	    - **The Keeper of Lore** – Documents the legacies of warriors, conquests, and fallen civilizations. Preserves the myths, philosophies, and tactical lessons of past wars. Ensures no victory or lesson is forgotten, and that history only records the worthy.
	    - **The Keeper of Flesh & Flame** – Prepares meals, rations, and food stores for warriors. Maintains ritualistic feasts, battle celebrations, and war initiations. Oversees pain rituals, body modifications, and the sacred war songs of the clan.
	- **The Blades** are often just soldiers or servants who do their bidding, as tho a job
- Warbonds are **closer than family**, acting as a single unit in all aspects of life.

### **Clan Structure (Extended Social Unit)**
- **Several Warbonds form an Ironclad (community unit).**
- **Multiple Ironclads form a Clan**, each led by a **6+12 governance structure** (Six Pillars and Twelve Blades).
- Clans are responsible for **resource management, internal justice, and large-scale decision-making.**
- One’s **identity is tied to their Clan**, and changing Clans is nearly impossible.

### **Romantic & Familial Bonds**

- **Romance is secondary to survival**—bonds are formed through shared endurance rather than emotional connection.
- Children are raised communally within **Ironclads**, with no concept of parental ownership.
- **Partnerships** may form within Warbonds, but **they are practical rather than sentimental.*

## **Structure of Society**

Tannon civilization is designed around **a rigid, militarized hierarchy**, ensuring that only the strongest, most capable individuals shape their future.

### **Social Stratification**

1. **Apex Council** – The ruling oligarchy of proven warlords and strategists.
2. **Circle of Proven** – Clan leaders and generals who manage regional affairs and war efforts.
3. **The Clans** – Each Clan maintains a fully self-sustaining society within the larger Tannon hierarchy.
4. **Ironclads** – The local governing body that ensures discipline and coordination between Warbonds.
5. **Warbonds** – The fundamental social unit, where all interpersonal interactions are grounded.
6. **The Chained (Enslaved Populations)** – Those conquered and deemed unworthy, used for labor and utility.

### **Rites of Passage & Ascension**

- **Challenges for Rank** – Any Tannon may rise in rank by defeating a superior in a test of endurance or combat.
- **The Scar Ritual** – Scars and body modifications signify trials survived, serving as living records of worth.
- **The Rite of Final Strength** – When a Tannon can no longer serve, they may undergo a last trial to die in glory.

## **Final Philosophy: A Life of Purpose**

To live as a Tannon is to **struggle, endure, and conquer**. Their society is built on **rigid discipline, structured hierarchy, and the belief that only through suffering can true strength be attained.** There is no place for weakness, and those who cannot serve must find a way to prove their worth—or be cast aside.
