The Tannon government is a **structured oligarchy**, where leadership is determined by **proven might, endurance, and conquest**. Governance is based on the philosophy of the **Eternal Test**, ensuring that only the strongest and most capable individuals rise to power.

## **Governing Bodies**

### **1. The Apex Council**

The highest ruling authority, composed of **6 to 12 of the most accomplished leaders**. Council members are warlords, conquerors, or strategists who have demonstrated their ability to maintain dominance. They oversee:

- War declarations and large-scale military campaigns.
- Enforcement of laws based on the Eternal Test.
- Internal disputes and succession challenges.
- Distribution and control of enslaved populations.

### **2. The Circle of Proven**

Below the Apex Council, this body consists of **clan leaders, generals, and warlords** responsible for:

- Regional governance and maintaining control over cities and strongholds.
- Directing military campaigns and strategic resource management.
- Enforcing clan-based discipline and upholding honor.

### **3. Clan Structure**

Tannon society is built upon **Clans**, each adhering to a rigid **6+12 leadership model**:

- **The Six Pillars**: Experts in medicine, strategy, craftsmanship, history, law, and sustenance, ensuring the Clan’s survival beyond battle.
- **The Twelve Blades**: Elite warriors and enforcers who maintain order and lead combat operations.

This structure ensures **continuity of leadership and the preservation of strength across generations.**

## **Law & Justice**

- The **Eternal Test** dictates all aspects of law—**strength is the ultimate measure of right and wrong.**
- **Failure is punishment itself**—those who falter are cast out, enslaved, or executed.
- **Treason is the highest crime**—betrayers are ritually erased from history and, in extreme cases, consumed as a form of purification.

## **Military & Expansion Doctrine**

- **Endless conquest is a necessity**, not a choice—expansion ensures the Tannon remain dominant.
- **The weak exist to be reforged into something stronger.**
- **Diplomacy is a form of submission**—only those who prove their worth through combat are recognized as allies.
- The *Eternal Test* is just a spiritual practice, not needed for resource allocation, due to the existence of EMC engines. As such initial resources are generated by the state or locally acquired

## **Cultural Philosophy**

- **Leadership is never granted—it is seized.**
- **A leader who cannot maintain power will be removed.**
- **To rule is to conquer, and to conquer is to ensure survival.**
