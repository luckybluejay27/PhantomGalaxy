# FTL Countermeasures

- **Gravity Cannon** – A high-powered gravity pulse that destabilizes an FTL field, forcing ships out of warp into real space.
- **Alcubierre Disruptors** – Devices that generate localized spacetime distortions, preventing stable Alcubierre-based FTL travel.
- **Warp Inhibitors** – Gravitational anchor points that force ships to remain in real space, commonly deployed in strategic locations.
- **FTL Signal Scramblers** – Disrupts a ship’s navigation systems, causing route miscalculations or forcing emergency deceleration.

## Counter-Countermeasures

- **Gravitic Well Shaping** – Using precisely positioned gravitational wells to counteract or dissipate external gravitational disturbances.
- **Closed Circuit Warp** – Dual-layered warp fields using additional planar rings to create a secondary spacetime bubble.
- **Signal Jamming** – Remote hacking and jamming tactics to disable or bypass interference mechanisms.

## FTL Failures & Hazards

- **Gravity Wells** – If a ship jumps too close to a gravity well without sufficient thrust to escape, extreme acceleration forces cause hull fractures and structural stress.
- **Signal Disruptors** – If caught in an EM radiation field or signal jammer, a ship may drop out of FTL while maintaining real-space acceleration below light speed.
- **Faulty Navigation Data** – Incorrect FTL calculations can send a ship into an asteroid field, a star, planetary atmosphere, or a completely random location with a fried navigation console.
