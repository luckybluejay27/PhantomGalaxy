**1. Biological Diversity**:  
- Archons are a coalition of various organic and synthetic beings.  
- Dominant biological forms include humans, Juvians, and minor populations from other species.  
- Synthetics (Synths) form the majority, with adaptive bodies and modular functions for various roles.

**2. Sensory Capabilities**:  
- Sensory abilities vary by origin—Juvians may detect UV and infrared, while Synths often have enhanced electromagnetic perception.  
- **Universal Adaptation:** Most residents use cranial implants or translators for seamless communication.

**3. Common Features Across the Population**:  
- **Cybernetic Adaptations:** Modular cybernetics are common for enhanced functionality.  
- **Adaptive Biochemistry:** Organics often receive microbiome adjustments for dietary flexibility.  
- **Respiratory Adaptations:** Stations maintain a majority-standard atmosphere, with filtration implants available for others.

**4. Synthetic Subpopulation**:  
- Synths adapt their frames for tasks from construction to diplomacy.  
- Neural cores mimic organic thought, though many retain Juvian-like directness.

**5. Plural Synth Majority**:
- Synths dominate the population, designed for diverse environments.  
- Modular limbs and sensory modules allow easy role transitions.  
- Synth communities practice software rituals, memory exchanges, and recalibration ceremonies.

**6. Cephalon Subconscious Network**:
- Cephalons are digital consciousness constructs from neural scans of deceased leaders.  
- These minds advise and preserve historical knowledge.  
- Cephalons exist in secure server vaults, interacting through public terminals and communication channels.
