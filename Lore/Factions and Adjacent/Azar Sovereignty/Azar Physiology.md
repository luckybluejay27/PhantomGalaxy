### Ontological Foundation

*Due to the nature of this species’ existence—being neither biological nor merely silicate—normal phylogenetic or ontological categories fall short of useful description. The Azar are not bound by material origin or evolutionary pathway. Instead, they manifest across a range of irreducible existential configurations.
Each Azar may shift freely between these modes of being. These states are not ranks or phases, but choice—expressions of purpose, experience, or function. The following are referred to as their **Irreducible States of Being (IRSB)**.*

# Irreducible States of Being (IRSB)

## Dormant

Dormant individuals rest deep within memory banks in the species most secure datacenters. The closest biological term is "suspended animation". Individuals that are made dormant are usually done so out of personal choice, or as a form of punishment. While dormant, an individual cannot be, and cannot experience at all. While it is temporally instantaneous from the dormant Azar's point of view, they miss anything that occurs during their dormancy. Dormancy also allows an individuals being to be laid bare to mind-walkers, Azar specialists who work to repair damaged individuals on the most core level.

## Simulacra

The most common state of being for the Azar during the Quarantine. Individuals in Simulacra are active within a virtual world, hosted on outward facing servers. These simulated realities can be accurate to reality, completely fictional, or anywhere in between. Within the Simulacra, most of the Azar's artforms, and scientific endeavors occur. The simulacra is networked, and siloed to prevent corruption and allow for Azar to travel between realms that have different rules. Despite this being the most common state for the Azar, it is extremely rare for a biological entity to be allowed to witness the Simulacra.

## Distributed

A more rare state, usually reserved only for Azar of high political and military state. Azar that are distributed exist in several physical locations at once, all bound via meshed communication networks. This allows Distributed individuals to instantly react to stimuli regardless of their locations. This is one of two states that require deep training and practice before it can be mastered. The sheer amount of possible stimuli, combined with having to link stimuli to actions, and react appropriately.

## Physio-Frame

Physio-Frame is the second most common state the Azar take. This state sees an individual linked to a self-sufficient body no greater than 3 tons in weight. These bodies, or "Frames" are capable of taking many shapes and sizes. Frames are the main way in which the Azar interact with, and measure the greater universe. They are also used for communication with external species, advanced physical maintenance on Azar holdings, and even warfare. These frames also allow for a great amount of physical choice-expression in how they are built and decorated.

## Physio-Giga

The Physio-Giga state is a branch of Physio-Frame, reserved for extremely large frames and vehicles. This state is separated due to the heightened amount of training that the individual must go through in order to be allowed to use high tonnage frames. While used heavily for hyper-structure construction, maintenance, and other industrial uses, they were also used heavily in warfare.
