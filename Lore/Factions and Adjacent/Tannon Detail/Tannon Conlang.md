## **How It Sounds in English**

A Tannon speaking English would sound like a **military commander or an AI tactician**—structured, directional, and highly intentional.

✅ **English:** *"We'll meet at the café tomorrow at noon."*  
❌ **Tannon-English:** *"Meet. Café. Time forward, mid-day."*  
✅ **English:** *"I disagree with you."*  
❌ **Tannon-English:** *"Stand opposite. Thought distant."*

**This language is made for a species that sees the world as a battlefield, a structure to be mapped, and a hierarchy to be enforced.** Every word is **tactical, purposeful, and rigidly efficient**.

## Example Sentence

1\. His blade stands alongside us (Equal)
\< havi-kɾā vū-vo brʌʢ yorvax-to ɡʰɾa-ma \>
"Stands (present) at/around blade Yorvax (equal) us (equal)."

## Sentence Structure

* **Verb → Preposition → Subject → Object → Pronoun → Honorific → Tense → Tense Modifier**  
* **Prepositional suffix order:** (Base \+ Primary Focus \+ Perspective) *(e.g., mūmu-nē → "moving away from above")*  
* **Pronouns are omitted when the subject is explicitly named.**  
* **Honorifics modify pronouns** (they become a single unit in speech and writing).  
* **Tenses are independent words**, placed at the end of the sentence.  
* **Honorifics apply to the recipient of the action,** not the speaker. Use the appropriate honorific to reflect the status of the referenced subject.  
* **Only necessary prepositional elements should be used**: Base is always required, Movement when needed, Perspective only when crucial.

## Example Sentence:

**1\. His blade stands alongside us (Equal)**
***\< havi-kɾā vū-vo brʌʢ yorvax-to ɡʰɾa-ma \>***
*"Stands (present) at/around blade Yorvax (equal) us (equal)."*

***2\. Their blades stand alongside us***
*\< havi-kɾā vū-vo brʌʢi ɾu-to ɡʰɾa-ma \>*
*"Stand (present) at/around blades they (equal) us (equal)."*

## Preposition System

* **Prepositions are singular concepts** with **movement-focused suffixes**.  
* **Modifiers prioritize movement**, with **secondary perspective shifts**.  
* **Suffix-based structure allows efficient command construction.**  
* **The order of suffixing is:** (Base \+ Primary Focus \+ Perspective)  
* **Use only necessary prepositional elements:** *Base → Movement → Perspective* in decreasing order of necessity.

| From | mū |
| Between | lū |
| Near | dā |
| Far | tū |
| Surrounding | xō |
| Against | ɣē |
| Along | sī |

### Movement-Based Modifiers (Primary Focus)

| **\-ka** | Moving toward | **kōka** → "toward" |
| **\-mu** | Moving away | **mūmu** → "away from" |

### Prepositional Combinations

## Superlatives

Superlatives use the word **'ban'** to indicate comparison, meaning something akin to **'exists as (in relation to).'**  
**Example:**

| English | Saurian |
| :---- | :---- |
| "Yorvax is bigger than Yivven." | **\< roga Yorvax-tá ban Yivven-tè \>** |

**Breakdown:**

| Component | Meaning |
| :---- | :---- |
| **roga** | "bigger" |
| **ban** | "than/existing as (in relation to)" |
| **Yorvax-tá** | "Yorvax (superior)" |
| **Yivven-tè** | "Yivven (inferior)" |

To express a **superlative of all**, **'ban'** is used with **'ette'** (meaning **"all"**).  
**Example:**

| English | Saurian |
| :---- | :---- |
| "Yorvax is the biggest of all." | **\< roga Yorvax-tá ban Ette \>** |

## Interrogative

Replace the prepositions in a sentence (since it inherently lacks spatial dimension), or replaces the noun being inquired.

Nominalized versions of interrogatives are used to refer to the questioning subject.

“The one Who Spoke left” → \<**Xolun ruki-kɾà\>**

Verbalized versions of interrogatives are used to turn the questioning into an action

"He is located far away." → \<**Ru-tá uli tū-kɾà\>**

| Translation | Word | Nominalization | Verbalization |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Who | Xol | Xolun | Xoli |
| What | Vol | Volun | Voli |
| When | Zol | Zolun | Zoli |
| Where | Hol | Holun | Uli |
| Why | Rol | Rolun | Roli |
| How | Mol | Molun | Moli |

## Functional Table

Flow markers are absent in Tannon speech, reflecting a linguistic structure that does not rely on transitional phrases. Terrans often find this challenging, as Tannon speakers may pause mid-sentence to consider their words, sometimes leading to prolonged group silences during discussions.

| Function | Word | Verb (if exists) | Closest Translation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Affirmative | ʢo |  | Yes/Agreed |
| Negative | bai |  | No/Disagreed |
| Conditional/Hypothetical | ħe |  | If |
| Command | kan(i) | Kani | Do (verb) |
| Forbid | ron(i) | Ronu | Do not (verb) |
| Emphatics | grav(i) |  |  |
