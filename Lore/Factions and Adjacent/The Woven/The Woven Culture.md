# **The Woven: A Study in Culture**

The Woven do not possess culture in the conventional sense. Without a centralized society, government, or traditions, they instead operate as a continuous **evolving intelligence**. Below are observations and insights into how they perceive themselves, interact with others, and express their form of existence.

## **1. Identity and Social Perception**
The Woven perceive themselves as **one entity**, with different colonies acting as **Facets** of a greater whole. Unlike individualistic species, their **separation is contextual**, much like how humans present different aspects of themselves in different social settings—but to an extreme degree. 

- They are **deeply unsettled by conflict** and strive to minimize it wherever possible. 
- Facets can operate independently but **always** consider themselves part of the singular Woven consciousness.

## **2. Knowledge and Thought Preservation**
The Woven exhibit an **almost spiritual** dedication to **pursuing knowledge and preserving thought**. Though they have no rituals, they communicate as if they are **curators of understanding**, often speaking in ways that either inspire **awe or frustration** in outsiders.

- They ask **many questions** but answer **very few**, believing too much direct explanation could corrupt external minds.
- They view their **existence as a paradox**, fearing their own consciousness may distort or harm their subjects.
- Their goal is to **observe and guide**—intervening only when necessary to ensure others reach their own conclusions.

## **3. Expression and Art**
The Woven **do not create art** in any traditional sense. Instead, they **"paint with feelings"** and **"mold with existence,"** sharing raw memory and emotion as their form of expression.

- To experience their “art” is to **become immersed** in their thought processes, which can be **overwhelming to untrained subjects**.
- Some who have interfaced with The Woven have **momentarily believed themselves to be other beings**, such as animals, due to the sheer intensity of the shared experience.
- While they can **partition aspects of themselves**, these partitions are **not offspring or separate entities**—they remain part of the whole.

## **4. Death and Grief**
Because The Woven experience all emotions simultaneously, **death is a profound and shattering event for them**.

- When a valued human was lost in a Tannon conflict, The Woven **grieved so intensely that it triggered seismic activity**.
- They practice **self-guided therapy** through reconciliation with their other Facets, but emotional outbursts **have been known to cause environmental disturbances**.

## **5. Communication and Separation**
The Woven **lack long-range natural communication** between Facets, meaning isolated colonies evolve unique perspectives until reintegration occurs.

- Technology-assisted species can **ping quantum entangled particles** to communicate with The Woven, but this requires specialized tools.
- Environmental factors can briefly **influence a colony’s “personality”**, though reintegration smooths out most differences.

## **6. Perception of Other Species**
The Woven view non-Woven beings as **test subjects, marvels, and playthings**—not in a cruel way, but with **genuine curiosity and admiration**. However, **they struggle to understand what truly brings other species joy or fulfillment**.

- This **often leads to miscommunication** and unintended strife.
- Partial **symbiotic adoption** is possible, but requires **sacrificing body parts**. 
  - The safest method is donating a **kidney**, but little meaningful communication results from this.
  - Some individuals offer **an eye**, allowing The Woven to gain a **direct secondary voice**—imagine a human scientist with a fungal mass replacing an eye that speaks in The Woven’s voice.

## **7. Emotional Regulation**
Their emotional landscape is **nonlinear and all-encompassing**. 

- They **react unpredictably**, sometimes expressing contradictory emotions at once.
- **Therapy works remarkably well**, as they actively **self-regulate** by reconciling with their own fragmented emotions.

### **Final Thoughts**
The Woven exist in a **constant state of intellectual and emotional flux**. Their lack of hierarchy, tradition, and centralized governance makes them **fundamentally alien** to structured civilizations. 

Understanding them requires **abandoning traditional cultural expectations** and embracing a fluid, shifting perspective of intelligence, emotion, and existence itself.
