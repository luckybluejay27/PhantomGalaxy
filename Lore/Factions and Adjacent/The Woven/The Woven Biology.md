# **Welcome to TF-65b: An Introduction to The Woven**

Congratulations on your arrival at **TF-65b Research and Science Plantation**, a premier installation of the **Terran Federation** dedicated to the study of The Woven. If you are reading this, you are now part of one of the most advanced scientific efforts in the known galaxy. Unlike traditional research stations, this facility operates as a **long-term residency**, meaning your assignment here is indefinite. Your role will be vital in expanding our understanding of this unique lifeform.

This document serves as your **introductory briefing**, providing foundational knowledge on The Woven before you begin specialized training. More detailed and technical manuals will be assigned based on your field of study.

## **Overview: The Woven and Their Biology**

The Woven are a **distributed bioelectric fungal network**, originating from a **unicellular Mycocyte**, an organism resembling both neurons and fungi in structure and function. Unlike typical fungi, Mycocytes **consume microbial life and simple sugars**, metabolizing them into **oxygen and sodium-based compounds** as byproducts. While an individual Mycocyte is non-sentient, their collective behavior leads to the emergence of intelligence.

---

## **Life Processes of The Woven**

- **Reproduction:** Mycocytes reproduce via binary fission, forming vast **interconnected cellular networks**. Over time, these networks evolve into complex **mycelial superstructures**, allowing the emergence of cognitive functions.

- **Consumption:** Mycocytes metabolize **simple sugars, microbial colonies, and organic detritus**. Nutrients are extracted via **specialized tendrils**, and some colonies have been observed fostering **symbiotic microbial cultures** to enhance efficiency.

- **Respiration:** Oxygen is produced as a metabolic byproduct, while **sodium compounds help regulate bioelectric conductivity**, enabling long-range **electrical communication** within colonies.

- **Growth & Adaptation:** The Mycocyte network dynamically expands and contracts based on **environmental stimuli**. High-resource areas develop into **dense cognitive hubs**, reinforcing **long-term memory retention** and decision-making ability.

- **Symbiotic Interaction:** The Woven integrate with their surroundings, forming **mutualistic relationships** with local ecosystems. Some species serve as **biological hosts**, while others link to The Woven via **neural interfacing**.

- **Dormancy & Survival:** Mycocytes can enter a **spore-like hibernation state** when conditions become inhospitable. This mechanism allows colonies to survive in extreme environments or regenerate after catastrophic damage.

## **The Emergence of Thought**

As Mycocyte networks reach a critical mass, they transition from **simple biochemical responses to structured cognition**. This occurs through:

1. **Synaptic Density Thresholds:** When a sufficient number of Mycocytes interconnect, **self-reinforcing electrochemical circuits** form, allowing information retention.
2. **Feedback Loops:** These networks develop recursive electrical activity, permitting **anticipatory responses** to environmental stimuli.
3. **Memory and Learning:** Through sustained neural activity, The Woven develop **spatial awareness, adaptive problem-solving, and coordinated behavior**.
4. **Distributed Intelligence:** Multiple dense cognitive hubs synchronize over bioelectric relays, creating a **planetary-scale neural network**.

## **Early Predation and Ethical Considerations**

Field Log #153 (restricted) documents an early-stage colony integrating with a **canine test subject**, showcasing neural mimicry and limited motor coordination. While The Woven **no longer require predation** in most environments, historical evidence suggests a period of **carnivorous behavior**, which the species itself finds distressing when confronted. As such, **TF-65b personnel are advised to avoid references to “predation” or “zombification” in direct interactions** with The Woven.

---

## **Physiological Structure & Scaling**

While The Woven exhibit a decentralized network structure, **individual colonies function as coherent biological “bodies”** with complex internal organization.

- **Specialization:** At approximately **600 pounds**, colonies develop **specialized organ-like structures** for respiration, mechanical function, and fluid circulation.
- **Neural Relay System:** Unlike human brains, The Woven’s **neural signals travel in directional wave patterns**, creating a **linear, relay-based cognition system**.
- **Sensory Capabilities:** Without a host, The Woven perceive **temperature, pressure, and electrical fields**. Rare mutations occasionally produce additional sensory organs.
- **Energy Constraints:** Growth is limited by **exponential metabolic demands**, necessitating **self-contained ecosystems** in larger bodies to prevent collapse.
- **Waste Processing:** Decay is rare, as **nearly all biological material is reintegrated**. The remaining waste products enrich soil, emitting a **notable sickly-sweet odor**.
- **Memory Storage & Errors:** Information is retained **bioelectrically**, ensuring high fidelity but also increasing **error propagation risks**—a single faulty neural node can spread misinformation throughout a colony.

## **Final Notes for New Personnel**

You are now part of a **permanent research initiative** within the **Terran Federation Science and Research Division**. Your work here will contribute to the continued understanding and cooperation between **humanity and The Woven**.

- Expect to be assigned **a specialty field** within your first year.
- You will undergo **mandatory training** in environmental safety, xenobiological ethics, and communication protocols.
- **Direct interaction with The Woven** is only permitted after completing **Level 2 clearance training**.

TF-65b is your home now, and your work is vital. Proceed with curiosity, caution, and respect.

## **Archived Field Logs and Audio Records**

### **Field Log #153 - Canine Integration Test**

**Date:** [Redacted]  
**Location:** TF-65b Research Facility  
**Subject:** Canine Test Organism #47  
**Lead Researcher:** Dr. Maren Kovač  

#### **Summary:**  
The subject, a deceased canine (*Canis lupus familiaris*), was introduced to an early-stage Mycocyte colony within a controlled containment chamber. The colony exhibited rapid filamentous extension, seeking entry points into the subject’s neural and circulatory pathways. Within four hours, bioelectric signatures were detected, indicating the establishment of synaptic mimicry.

#### **Observations:**
- **Hour 1-2:** Initial colonization was restricted to the dermal layers and open wounds. No observable response beyond metabolic consumption.
- **Hour 3:** Filament extension reached the brainstem and peripheral nervous system. Localized electrical discharges were recorded.
- **Hour 4:** Coordinated movement in the subject’s forelimb was detected. EEG readings suggest bioelectric modulation mimicking neural firing patterns.
- **Hour 5:** Partial motor control was observed, demonstrating reflexive twitching and involuntary jaw movement.
- **Hour 6:** Neural integration plateaued; limited sensory relay was achieved, but no evidence of independent cognition was noted.

#### **Conclusion:**  
The Mycocyte colony demonstrated an ability to interpret and propagate pre-existing neural pathways but lacked the density required for autonomous decision-making. Further research into **synaptic density thresholds** is recommended.

#### **Ethical Considerations:**  
Due to the nature of the observed interactions, replication of this experiment on higher cognitive organisms is pending review by the Ethics Committee. Auditory logs from this session contain distressing involuntary vocalizations and are restricted to authorized personnel only.
