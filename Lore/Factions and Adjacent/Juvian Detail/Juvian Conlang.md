### Example Verb

The translation for "walk" is *irm*.

[irm|i] - [You walk]

### Pronouns

The following is a list of pronouns. Their translations are suffixes to the verb when translating.

| Pronoun         | Translation |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| I               | «Äi          |
| You (Singular)  | «Äu          |
| You (Plural)    | l           |
| They (Singular) |  ía«Ä         |
| They (Plural)   |  ía«Äu        |
| We (Group)      |  ían         |
| We (Not Group)  |  íanu        |

Example: [irm|i]

---

### Tenses

The following is a table of tenses. Tenses are an additional suffix appearing after the pronoun suffix. Pick a tense, take the translation found in its adjacent cell (next in row), and add it to the word.

| Tense              | Tense Suffix |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Present Simple     | n/a          |
| Present Continuous | ka           |
| Present Perfect    | k…∏           |
| Past Simple        |  ía           |
| Past Continuous    |  í…∏           |
| Past Perfect       |  íu           |
| Future Simple      | Œ≤a           |
| Future Continuous  | Œ≤…∏           |
| Future Perfect     | Œ≤u           |

Example: [irm|ika] directly translates to "I am walking."

Quantifiers and Prepositions appear prior to the noun, unless modifying a verb or succeeding noun.

Nouns are only modified via numbers or similar concepts like "many" or "none". Usually as a hyphenated prefix to the noun in question.
Nouns are never conjugated.

## Conditionals

| English | Translation |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Should  | ni          |
| Would   | bri         |
| Could   | «Äri         |
| If      | ?e          |
| Like    | «Åo          |
|         |             |

Conditionals modify verbs, but appear prior to the conjugated form, as a word. Much like "Should Have" in English does.

---
## Relative and Comparative Grammar

In Juvian, relative constructions are formed by applying a **prefix to the verb**, modifying the action itself rather than the subject or object. These prefixes indicate the type of comparison being made. There is no marker, the prefix is attached to the working verb.

| Concept            | Prefix | Translation Example   | English Approximation                          |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| More (than)        | koka   | koka-irmli  ía«Ä        | I walk more than                               |
| Less (than)        | roka   | roka-lat ía«Ä  ía«Äu      | they (singular) eat less than them (plural)    |
| Most (of all)      | su…∏a   | su…∏a-nekli lu         | I sleep more than most of you                  |
| Least (of all)     | «Äuta   | luta-fel íaŒ≤ lu        | We give less than you                          |
| As (adj) as        | teko   | teko-kas ían koni  íanu | We (group) lift as much as we (not group)      |
| Too (adj)          | tayko  | tayko-zet ía«Ä          | They (singular) see too much                   |
| Enough (to X)      | meka   | meka-mukli tok ían     | I speak enough to take (we, group)             |
| Than (linker word) | koni   |                       | (used after subject, before comparison target) |

## Juvian Interrogatives ‚Äì Unchained Verbalizations

Interrogatives in Juvian are not standalone nouns but **verb-rooted queries** that cannot be nominalized. These forms behave as "unchained verbalizations"‚Äîa verb posed in isolation or minimal context, querying action, identity, method, or reasoning. They are always structured around a **conjugated verb**, with the subject often implied or marked with suffix.

They **cannot** be:

- Converted into nouns (e.g., "the what")
- Used without a verb stem
- Freestanding as subjects or objects

Instead, interrogatives are built as follows:

```
[interrogative root]-[verb root][pronoun suffix]?
```

### Table: Core Juvian Interrogative Roots

| English      | Juvian Root | Function / Domain      | Example                    | Gloss                |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Who          | **zet-**    | Identity / Agent       | **zet-…πpuŒ≤…∏ îu?**           | Who eats?            |
| What         | **fet-**    | Object / Action target | **fet- ä…∏ î…∏ ía î?**           | What did they sleep? |
| When         | **tok-**    | Time / Sequence        | **tok-elu…∏ ía î?**           | When did they give?  |
| Where        | ** Éok-**    | Place / Location       | ** Éok-ki…πk…∏ ían?**          | Where do we take?    |
| Why          | **nek Éa-**  | Cause / Reason         | **nek Éa-…™q…∏ îu?**           | Why do you speak?    |
| How (manner) | **teka-**   | Method / Process       | **teka-…πpuŒ≤…∏ ían?**         | How do we eat?       |
| Which        | **hera-**   | Choice / Specificity   | **hera-elu…∏ ía î koni hok?** | Which did they give? |
| Whose        | ** íeta-**   | Possession / Ownership | ** íeta-…πpuŒ≤…∏lu?**          | Whose food is eaten? |


> All roots must be bound to a verb. Context completes their meaning.

---

### How + X Constructions (Bound-Only)

Juvian disallows standalone measurements like ‚Äúhow long.‚Äù Instead, use **"how" + attribute verb**, optionally followed by a comparative or object. Context fills in the missing subject.

|English Expression|Juvian Form|Gloss|
|---|---|---|
|How long is it?|**teka-s…∏aq ía î**|How is it long?|
|How far did you go?|**teka-t'ap îu?**|How did you travel?|
|How much did they eat?|**teka-…πpuŒ≤…∏ ía î**|How did they eat?|

Suffixes like ** îi,  îu,  ía î,  ían** can be appended to reflect personhood.

## Verbal Negation

### `?an` ‚Äì The Verbalized Negative

In Juvian, negation is expressed through a family of dedicated, **non-conjugating verbs**‚Äîanchored by the root `?an`. These are not grammatical auxiliaries but **standalone conceptual actions** representing specific types of negation. They precede the verbs or clauses they negate and are never inflected for subject, tense, or aspect.
- `?an` ‚Äì General negation: "not"
- `?ani` ‚Äì Euphonic variant before glottal or hard consonant verbs
- `?anitu` ‚Äì Describes the **state or quality** of being negative (abstract/adj)
### üîª Expanded `?an` Family of Conceptual Negators

| Category                  | Root                | Function / Context Example                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Refusal (willful)         | `?ankor`            | "refuse to speak"                                                   |
| Reversal / Undoing        | `?anketa`           | Negating causality, reversing motion                                |
| Nonexistence              | `?anta`             | "there is not", existential absence                                 |
| Exclusion / Absence       | `?annok` / `?anoki` | "without," "lacking," phonetic softening                            |
| Termination / Cessation   | `?ansul`            | "no longer", ended condition                                        |
| Ineffectiveness / Failure | `?anrex`            | failed result, ineffective outcome                                  |
| Doubt / Uncertainty       | `?anek(a)`          | negation of belief, epistemic skepticism                            |
| Emotional Rejection       | `?ansha`            | gentle or internalized denial                                       |
| State of Negation         | ?anit(u)            | State or quality of negative, or to negate state, or negate quality |

These forms express **precise semantic functions**, not general negation. They serve as verbs in their own right and operate outside the normal conjugation system.
### üîπ Syntax: Modifier Negation

```
[?an / ?ani] [conjugated verb]
```

| English                   | Juvian            | Gloss                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| I do not walk             | `?an irmli`       | not walk-I               |
| You are not eating        | `?ani …πpuŒ≤ka«Äu`   | not eat-ing-you          |
| They (pl) didn‚Äôt speak    | `?ani muk ía î ía«Äu` | not speak-past-they (pl) |
| We (group) do not give    | `?an elu ían`      | not give-we              |
| I absolutely will not eat | `?ani …πpuŒ≤Œ≤a«Äi`   | strong not eat-future-I  |

---

### üîπ Examples: Independent Conceptual Negation

These root forms can also appear alone or as predicates in declarative, philosophical, or rhetorical contexts.

| Root     | Usage Example     | Meaning               |
| -------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| `?an`    | `?an irmli`       | I do not walk         |
| `?ani`   | `?ani muk ía î ía«Äu` | They are not speaking |
| `?anitu` | `?anitu pa É îa`    | A negative state      |
| `?annok` | `?annok ferik îu`  | You lack the resource |
| `?ankor` | `?ankor muk îi`    | I refuse to speak     |
| `?anta`  | `?anta fetta?`    | Does it not exist?    |
| `?ansul` | `?ansul elu ía«Ä`   | He no longer gives    |

### üîπ Core Properties

- All `?an`-root negators are **fixed-form**‚Äîthey do not conjugate.
- Each represents a **specific semantic domain** (refusal, absence, failure, etc.).
- May be used as **standalone statements** or as **modifiers** preceding full verbs.
- Reflect the Juvian view of negation as a **complete and deliberate action**, not a mere grammatical toggle.

---
## Prepositions

### Anchor Set
- **[Anchor]** ‚Äì Root noun designating the fixed point or entity from which direction is derived. Must always be declared unless speaker is implicit.
- **[Positive]** ‚Äì Signifier or contextual tag defining the "forward" or default vector relative to the anchor.
- **[Negative]** ‚Äì Inversion of [Positive]; movement or rotation against the defined direction.

> All directional operations require a **frame of reference**. This must include:
> 1. An **Anchor** ‚Äî a fixed noun or entity.
> 2. An **Axis** ‚Äî plane of motion (e.g., yaw, pitch, roll).
> 3. A **Polarity** ‚Äî indication of directionality (positive/negative) from that anchor.

Without an anchor and defined vector polarity, directional commands are semantically void.

| --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0         | 0      | et (ette)                             | 0 (00)           |

| 32        | 40     | kekke                                 | [D0]             |
| 40        | 50     | hokke                                 | [E0]             |
| 64        | 100    | hetke'hette                           | [A00]            |
| 512       | 1000   | hetke'hetteke                         | [A000]           |
| 1000,7654 | ‚Äî      | hetke'hette uŒ≤t rokke nokke hokke kek | [A000,GFED]      |
### Bracketed Notations

> - [A]‚Äì[G] = 1‚Äì7
> - [A0] = base-8 value 10 (decimal 8)
> - This system allows for **stackable, intuitive markers** that avoid confusion with base-10 Terran logic.

---

### Digit Blocks & uŒ≤t|

- Digits stack in **quads** (4 digits per block), reflecting Juvian physiology.
- `uŒ≤t|` marks block transitions, acting as a verbal comma.
- Only used **between full 4-digit clusters**.

> E.g. `rokke'nokke'hokke'kek uŒ≤t rekke'tekke'hekke'et` = 2 full stacks

**End-Marking Rule**: The **last digit in any stack is not pluralized** (i.e., does not take the `'ke` suffix), serving as a stable unit marker. This reflects natural speech rhythm and semantic anchoring‚Äîsimilar to how humans distinguish ‚Äútwelve‚Äù from ‚Äútwenty.‚Äù This includes 0 (ette), which becomes **et** in end position.

Formal speech may quantify this as: *"three-stack figure."*

---

### Modular System (Letter-Based Notation with Morphological Clarity)

- Letter brackets represent **group identifiers**, not raw values.
- `[A0]` = 1 group of 8 ‚Üí `hette`
- `[A00]` = 1 group of 64 ‚Üí `hetke'hette`
- `[A000]` = 1 group of 512 ‚Üí `hetke'hetteke`

**Morphological Pattern:**
- Numbers follow a consistent **<root> + 'ke'** form to indicate group scaling.
- **Exception**: The final digit in each quad **does not** take `'ke`, preserving its root form as a positional anchor.
- **Further Exception**: The root `ette` becomes **et** when used as a terminal digit.

**Naming pattern:** `[NŒ∏] = <root> + 'ke'`

> [G] + [A] = [A0] ‚Üí triggers new digit group

**Example (Quad Stack Transliteration):**
> `[ABCD,EFG0]` ‚Üí `rokke'nokke'hokke'kek uŒ≤t rekke'tekke'hetke'et`

Letter brackets **clarify** scale and **preserve Juvian mod logic**; `uŒ≤t` structures stack breaks.
