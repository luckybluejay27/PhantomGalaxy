**Organisms of Juvia – Phylogeny** describes the highest‑level biological classification framework used in Juvian biological sciences. It outlines the four primary phylogenetic divisions recognized on Juvia and summarizes the criteria by which lineages are assigned to each division.

The framework is lineage‑based and reflects evolutionary descent rather than purely functional or morphological grouping. Terran and Juvian biological sciences arrived at comparable phylogenetic logic through parallel development. Early Juvian classification began with ecological and material observation but, as with Terran biology, converged on evolutionary lineage as the primary organizing principle. As a result, the highest divisions correspond to foundational survival strategies and material constraints that proved evolutionarily stable over time, rather than superficial visual similarity.

This article provides an overview only and does not enumerate species or lower taxonomic ranks. Each Level‑1 descriptor links to dedicated articles detailing internal phylogeny, morphology, metabolism, and ecological roles.

## Roqutet

Roqutet are organisms defined by **mobility‑dependent consumption**.

Organisms classified under Roqutet require **self‑directed locomotion** to acquire the resources necessary for survival and reproduction. Energy intake is achieved through the ingestion of pre‑organized biological matter, and internal systems are optimized for rapid redistribution of energy, nutrients, and sensory input.

Roqutet lineages typically exhibit:

- Persistent individual bodily identity
    
- Active predation, foraging, or scavenging behaviors
    
- Internal transport systems supporting rapid response
    
- Evolutionary pressure favoring coordination, perception, and decision‑making
    

Mobility alone is not sufficient for Roqutet classification; rather, **the inability to survive without directed movement** is the defining criterion.

## Anetet

Anetet are organisms defined by **anchored autotrophic growth with internal circulation**.

Organisms within Anetet derive energy directly from environmental gradients such as stellar radiation, geothermal flux, or chemical differentials. They are growth‑bound rather than locomotion‑bound, and survival does not require pursuit or evasion behaviors.

A defining feature of Anetet lineages is the presence of **internal transport media** used to distribute nutrients, reactive compounds, and structural materials throughout the organism. On Juvia, many Anetet utilize **iron‑based reactive fluids**, where oxidation and reduction are integral to metabolism rather than pathological decay.

Anetet lineages typically exhibit:

- Fixed or growth‑limited spatial anchoring
    
- Structural expansion rather than movement
    
- Environmental energy conversion
    
- Long persistence cycles relative to Roqutet organisms

## Pirutet

Pirutet are organisms defined by **passive heterotrophic assimilation**.

Pirutet organisms do not rely on self‑directed locomotion to obtain energy. Instead, they acquire nutrients through **external digestion, absorption, or interception**, often exploiting the biological activity of Roqutet or Anetet lineages.

Growth in Pirutet lineages follows substrate availability rather than internal developmental staging. Individual identity may be diffuse, colonial, or transient, with continuity expressed through persistent networks rather than discrete bodies.

Pirutet lineages typically exhibit:

- Absorptive or invasive nutrient acquisition
    
- Limited or absent locomotion
    
- Colony‑based or field‑distributed identity
    
- Strong ecological dependence on other kingdoms

## Woqutet

Woqutet are organsims defined by **non‑carbon‑dominant molecular substrates**.

Organisms classified under Woqutet utilize alternative structural chemistries—most commonly silicate or lattice‑based frameworks—while still exhibiting metabolism, growth, and lineage continuity. Energy acquisition is environmental, and reproduction or persistence may occur through accretion, crystallization, or gradual lattice propagation rather than discrete generational cycles.

Woqutet lineages are considered fully biological under Juvian standards, despite lacking Terran biochemical conventions.

Woqutet lineages typically exhibit:

- Alternative molecular backbones
    
- Environmental energy utilization
    
- Continuous or non‑cyclical growth patterns
    
- Long temporal stability relative to carbon‑based organisms
    

## Qivutiket

Qivutiket are organisms defined by **intentional artificial origin** rather than endogenous evolutionary descent.

Organisms classified under Qivutiket originate through deliberate construction by an external sapient agent rather than through unguided biological reproduction. Lineage continuity is established after instantiation through persistence, replication, or structural inheritance rather than genetic descent.

Qivutiket organisms may persist as autonomous individuals, distributed systems, or networked entities. Internal resource distribution, when present, is achieved through engineered analogues or simulated processes rather than organically evolved circulatory or digestive systems. Energy source alone is not classificatory.

Qivutiket lineages typically exhibit:

- Technological or engineered initial instantiation
    
- Absence of evolved biological metabolism at origin
    
- Persistence through maintenance, replication, or system continuity
    
- Capacity for adaptation independent of original design intent
    

Qivutiket was formalized as a distinct phylogenetic division following first contact with Archon Continuum entities, to account for lineages whose ancestry is technological in origin but whose persistence, adaptation, and continuity satisfy Juvian criteria for organismal status.

## Notes on Lineage and Translation

All five Level‑1 descriptors represent **true lineage divisions** within Juvian phylogeny. Terran analogues such as “animal,” “plant,” or “fungus” are used only as provisional translation aids and should not be treated as equivalent biological categories.

Further subdivision occurs at subsequent phylogenetic levels, where evolutionary descent, morphological divergence, and ecological specialization are described in detail within linked documents.
