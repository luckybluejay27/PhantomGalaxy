# Galactic Spins (GS)

- **A Galactic Spin (GS) is 10 millionth of a full galactic rotation (~22.5 Terran Years).**
    
- **Each GS is divided by 1000 into decimal Galactic Spins (dGS), expressed as whole numbers (e.g., 024 dGS instead of 0.024 GS).**
    
- **1 dGS = ~8.2 Terran Days**, making it a practical measure for year-based tracking.
    
- **This system is maintained by the International Freelance Guild & Queen of History for interstellar archival records.**
    
- The **naming is symbolic rather than literal**, ensuring it remains **a neutral standard across different factions** for historical and contractual reference.
    
- This ensures **Galactic Spins function as a practical "yearly" measurement** while retaining their **cosmic significance**. üöÄ

## **Post-Scarcity Economy: No Credits, Only Contribution**  

The **post-scarcity economy** of most factions is driven by **Energy-Matter Converters (EMC) and Hybrid Reactors**, eliminating scarcity and centralized markets in favor of **knowledge, exploration, and societal enrichment**. **Currency, credits, or monetary systems do not exist in any form**‚Äîinstead, value is based on **contributions, reputation, and the exchange of expertise.**  

### **Key Features:**  
- **No Money, No Credits:** Economic interactions function **without financial transactions**, relying instead on **skill exchange, favor-based agreements, and knowledge-sharing.**  
- **Decentralized Production:** Goods are produced locally via **EMC technology**, eliminating material scarcity.  
- **Collaborative Value System:** Prestige comes from **scientific, artistic, and humanitarian contributions** rather than wealth accumulation.  
- **Universal Abundance:** **Basic survival needs (food, shelter, healthcare) are freely met**, removing economic barriers.  
- **Specialized Trades Exist:** While material scarcity is eliminated, **skilled labor remains valuable**‚Äîfields like **starship engineering, diplomacy, and research thrive on mutual exchange.**

# Redefinitions

## Companies as "Guilds"

Considering how nearly all factions are post-scarcity, the idea of business is eroded. As such, most places are meritocratic. Companies are simply collectivist interests in a given field.

## Contracts as Desire Exchanges

A contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange complex goods the opposite party desires.
