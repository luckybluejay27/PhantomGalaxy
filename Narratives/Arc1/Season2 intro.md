TITLE SEQUENCE – PHANTOM GALAXY
INT. ARCHON ORBITAL – VARIOUS LOCATIONS

Flashing shots, rapid and dynamic, each cut charging the momentum:

— A panoramic bridgeway. The vast expanse of Archon Orbital hangs in the void, silhouetted against the burning glow of a distant star. Humans, Juvians, and Synths move as one, purpose in every step.

— The residential districts. Modular homes spiral in perfect geometry. Holographic windows flicker with life—conversations, lessons, stories written and rewritten in real-time.

— A bustling commercial hub. Juvian baristas trill in their native tongue, crafting drinks as a Synth arranges pastries with meticulous precision. The murmuring crowd weaves a rhythmic harmony of languages, cultures, ideals.

FEMALE VOICEOVER
"We do not dictate destiny."

— A medbay. Clinical, efficient—yet undeniably alive. A Tannon soldier, restrained, exhales sharply as a Maid Foundation nurse runs a scanner over jagged wounds. Nearby, an Archon physician enters data, cold calculations balancing empathy.

— A war room. A dozen minds at work—philosophers, strategists, scientists—feeding data into holographic projections: legislative drafts, battle simulations, quantum probability matrices.

"We create order to justify our own existence."
HARD CUT – THE BATTLEFIELD

— Ground forces advance. Terran, Juvian, Archon—sigils of a fragile coalition gleaming under alien suns. Some march with confidence. Others hesitate, gazing into the abyss of history repeating itself.

— In orbit. A mixed fleet—Terran warships, Juvian frigates, Archon diplomatic cruisers—hangs motionless in space. Engines hum at subsonic frequencies. Weapons charge. Targeting solutions lock.

"And so, rebels must prove our worth."

— A Juvian scholar, fingers tracing the spiraling arcs of their language, inscribes a judgment that will alter the course of diplomacy.

— A high-stakes negotiation. Two factions meet in a silent standoff—expressions unreadable, but the weight of history suffocating the air.

— A student, deep in an archive. Their fingers tremble over a digital ledger—a history long buried, waiting to be unsealed.

"We ARE the rebellion."

PHANTOM GALAXY
A crescendo of brass. Percussion ignites. The fanfare erupts like the clash of distant war drums—a call to action, a promise of upheaval.
