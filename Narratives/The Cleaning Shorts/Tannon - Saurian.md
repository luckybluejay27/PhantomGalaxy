### **SCENE: RESEARCH STATION CLEANING BAY**

_A large containment area with reinforced walls. A deep,_ **_boiling_** _water tub sits in one corner, steam rising._*

_Angie stands before_ **_Ruk'Thar_**_, who is seated on a massive steel bench. His_ **_thick, carbine-keratin scales_** _are_ **_matte black with deep crimson ridges._** _He watches with a mix of curiosity and mild concern._

---

**ANGIE:** _(Holding up an industrial-grade metal scrubber, smirking)_ "Alright, big guy. Let’s get you cleaned up."

**RUK’THAR:** _(Frowning, arms crossed)_ "I do not understand. We **soak** in acid baths and scrape against stone nails. You… what is this?"

**ANGIE:** _(Confidently tapping the scrubber against her palm)_ "This? **Advanced human cleaning technology.** Your scales are tough, sure, but I’ve got just the thing."

**RUK’THAR:** _(Snorts, flexing a claw)_ "I would **break** that thing in two."

**ANGIE:** _(Grinning)_ "Not a chance. Let’s get scrubbing."

### **ATTEMPT #1: THE SCRUBBER MEETS ITS MATCH**

_Angie presses the_ **_reinforced metal scrubber_** _against Ruk’Thar’s shoulder and drags it down._*

**Horrible screeching metal-on-metal noise.**

_Angie’s confident expression_ **_drops instantly_** _as she looks at the scrubber._ **_The entire surface is stripped bare._** _It’s now a smooth, useless hunk of steel._

**ANGIE:** _(Blinking)_ "Uh."

**RUK’THAR:** _(Raises an eyebrow ridge)_ "...Are you **cleaning me,** or am I **cleaning that?**"

**Dr. Grant and the other researchers chuckle from behind the observation glass.**

---

### **ATTEMPT #2: INDUSTRIAL POWER BRUSH**

**A loud, high-powered spinning brush whirs to life. Angie, now visibly frustrated, slams it against Ruk’Thar’s back.**

_The bristles are_ **_immediately_** _shredded. The motor screams in agony before bursting into a small puff of smoke._

_Ruk’Thar_ **_does not react._** _He just sits there, unimpressed._

**ANGIE:** _(Gritting her teeth, turning to the researchers)_ "HOW DO THEY EVEN GET DIRTY?!"

**RUK’THAR:** _(Shrugs)_ "We **do not.** The filth burns off in the bath."

**ANGIE:** _(Rubbing her temple)_ "Okay. Plan C."

---

### **ATTEMPT #3: THE BOILING WATER SOLUTION**

**Angie drags a massive hose connected to a reinforced boiling water tank.**

**ANGIE:** _(Triumphant)_ "Okay, this one’s **foolproof.** We’re doing this the Tannon way."

**RUK’THAR:** _(Perking up slightly)_ "You honor tradition? Good."

*She cranks the valve. **Superheated water floods over Ruk’Thar’s scales.**

**Nothing happens.**

**Except…**

**RUK’THAR:** _(Letting out a deep, satisfied sigh, leaning back)_ "Ahhhh. Yes. This is acceptable."

_He slowly lowers himself into the tub,_ **_fully submerging_** _with just his snout above water._

**Angie watches, slack-jawed.**

**ANGIE:** _(Defeated)_ "So you’re telling me… I didn’t need to do **ANY** of this?"

**RUK’THAR:** _(From the water, eyes closed in bliss)_ "I would have done it **myself** if you simply let me in the tub."

_Dr. Grant lets out an actual laugh. The other researchers are_ **_dying_** _in the background._

---

### **FINAL ATTEMPT: THE LAST-DITCH EFFORT**

_Angie, completely dead inside, picks up a_ **_small hand towel_** _and rubs it half-heartedly over Ruk’Thar’s head._

_For the_ **_first time_** _in this entire ordeal… Ruk’Thar actually_ **_pauses._** _His eyes open, and he blinks._

**RUK’THAR:** _(Mildly surprised)_ "...Huh. That was not unpleasant."

**ANGIE:** _(Staring blankly, monotone)_ "Glad… to be of service."

---

### **CLOSING NOTE:**

*Angie, utterly exhausted, watches as **Ruk’Thar proceeds to clean himself in the boiling water, completely ignoring her existence.**

_Dr. Grant pats her on the shoulder, still chuckling._

**DR. GRANT:** _(Smirking)_ "Look on the bright side, Lee. At least you didn’t have to deal with their **avians.**"

**ANGIE:** _(Weakly)_ "...What do you mean?"
