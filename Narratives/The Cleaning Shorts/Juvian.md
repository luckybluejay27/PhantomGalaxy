### **SCENE: Juvian Containment Bay**

_A sterile, well-lit cleaning chamber, fitted with_ **_low-gravity supports_** _to accommodate the Juvian’s natural climbing tendencies._ **_S'kiriin_**_, a_ **_tall, chitin-armored, multi-limbed Juvian_**_, sits calmly as_ **_Michael Harper methodically oils his joints._** _The process is_ **_uneventful._**

_Michael looks_ **_incredibly pleased_** _with himself._

---

### **ATTEMPT #1: "DONE ALREADY?"**

**MICHAEL:** _(Stretching, cracking knuckles)_ "And that, my friend, is how you professionally oil an exoskeleton. You feel any better?"

**S’KIRIIN:** _(Rolling multiple shoulders, nodding in approval)_ "Yes. Smooth articulation. No internal grinding. Effective."

**MICHAEL:** _(Grinning, looking at Dr. Grant through the observation window)_ "See that? Easiest assignment. You guys got **birds**, **murder-lizards**, and a **fungal therapy session.** I got **a well-mannered guy who just needed some oil.**"

**DR. GRANT:** _(Smirking, sipping coffee)_ "Well, Mike, that would be true. Except… you forgot **one** thing."

**MICHAEL:** _(Still smug)_ "Oh?"

**S’KIRIIN:** _(Casually, as if stating the weather)_ "You must also clean my burrow."

---

### **ATTEMPT #2: UNDERSTANDING THE TASK**

**MICHAEL:** _(Pause. Staring. Processing.)_ "...Burrow?"

**S’KIRIIN:** _(Nods, completely unbothered)_ "Yes. The silk accumulates. It is inefficient."

**MICHAEL:** _(Blinking, glancing at Dr. Grant suspiciously)_ "And you… didn’t **mention this before** because—?"

**DR. GRANT:** _(Grinning behind the glass, absolutely delighted)_ "Didn’t ask."

**MICHAEL:** _(Sighs, rubbing his temples)_ "Okay. Fine. How bad could it be?"

*S’Kiriin **casually gestures** toward a reinforced **chamber door.**

_Michael opens it._*

*He is greeted by **an absolute maze of woven silk webbing, spanning floor to ceiling.** Some strands are **thicker than his arm.** The walls are **entirely hidden** behind layers of **intricate, reinforced silk structures.** The air is **heavy with the faint smell of organic fiber.**

**MICHAEL:** _(Deadpan, staring into the abyss)_ "Oh. So it’s **this** kind of day."

---

### **ATTEMPT #3: "JUST BURN IT, RIGHT?"**

**MICHAEL:** _(Determined, holding up a_ **_high-heat sterilization tool_**_)_ "Alright, look. This is how humans handle tangled messes: **fire.** A quick **controlled burn**, and we’re—"

**S’KIRIIN:** _(Firmly, raising a clawed limb)_ "**Do not burn it.**"

**MICHAEL:** _(Pauses, lowering the tool slightly)_ "Why not?"

**S’KIRIIN:** _(Calm, but deeply ominous)_ "You do not wish to inhale vaporized silk."

**MICHAEL:** _(Blinking, turning slightly pale)_ "Why?"

**S’KIRIIN:** _(Still calm, folding two arms in an oddly relaxed way)_ "Toxic. Sticky. Lethal."

**MICHAEL:** _(Dropping the sterilizer like it’s made of lava)_ "OH COOL. WOULD’VE BEEN NICE TO KNOW **TEN SECONDS AGO.**"

---

### **ATTEMPT #4: THE RIGHT WAY**

**MICHAEL:** _(Muttering, dragging out industrial solvent tanks)_ "Can’t burn it, can’t leave it. Guess we’re doing this the hard way."

_He begins_ **_methodically dissolving_** _the layers of silk with_ **_enzyme-based cleaners,_** _watching as_ **_giant strands loosen and drop._**

**S’KIRIIN:** _(Casually assisting, holding sections in place)_ "This is preferable."

**MICHAEL:** _(Dripping sweat, staring at the_ **_mountains_** _of silk still remaining)_ "Oh yeah, **so preferable.**"

---

### **THE AFTERMATH: HOURS LATER**

*Michael emerges from the chamber, covered **head to toe** in sticky residue and silk strands. He looks **completely destroyed.**

**DR. GRANT:** _(Trying not to laugh, arms crossed)_ "So, **easiest job**, huh?"

**MICHAEL:** _(Hoarse, exhausted)_ "Shut. Up."

*S’Kiriin steps out, **spotless, pristine, and completely fine.**

**S’KIRIIN:** _(Satisfied, stretching four arms at once)_ "Burrow is now efficient. Appreciation."

**MICHAEL:** _(Weakly thumbs-up, collapses onto a chair)_ "Uh-huh. Yep. Glad to help. Gonna… gonna go rethink my life now."

---

### **CLOSING SHOT:**

*Michael, absolutely **dead inside**, sits in the decontamination bay **being hosed down.**

*S’Kiriin watches from nearby, **completely unbothered.**

_Dr. Grant, still_ **_amused beyond reason,_** _walks away, whistling._

**FADE TO BLACK.**
