**Title:** **"Therapy and Dead Matter"**

**Characters:**

- **Christie Yung** – A patient but slightly exasperated human researcher.
    
- **The Woven (Designation: Veil-Through-Veil)** – A **semi-sapient fungal colony**, struggling with the concept of "cleaning."
    
- **Dr. Elijah Grant** – Supervisor, deeply entertained by Christie’s predicament.
    
- **Various Other Researchers** – Watching from the observation deck, avoiding involvement.

### **SCENE: ISOLATION CHAMBER – WOVEN HABITAT**

*A **dimly lit, humid containment room** filled with pulsating, fungal tendrils and creeping bioluminescence. Soft, rhythmic breathing-like sounds echo as **Veil-Through-Veil**, the Woven colony in question, **extends part of itself to greet Christie Yung.**

*Christie, standing in a sterilized suit, **grimaces at the sheer volume of dead organic matter piled up in the center of the room.** It **reeks.**

### **ATTEMPT #1: DIRECT COMMUNICATION**

**CHRISTIE:** _(Calm, hands on hips)_ "Okay, Veil, we talked about this. You **cannot** just… accumulate corpses."

_A ripple of light pulses through the_ **_Woven’s mass_**_. A chorus of_ **_whispering, layered voices_** _fills the air._

**VEIL-THROUGH-VEIL:** _(Curious, innocent)_ "But… it is **ours**. They are **we**. They are **memory.**"

**CHRISTIE:** _(Pinching the bridge of her nose)_ "Yes, but they’re also **rotting**. And **we’re all suffering for it.**"

---

### **ATTEMPT #2: LOGIC AND COMPROMISE**

**CHRISTIE:** _(Gesturing to a datapad)_ "Look, decomposition **is** natural, sure. But **inside a sealed research station?** It’s a health hazard."

*A slow **pulse of violet light** ripples through the Woven’s surface, indicating **thought.**

**VEIL-THROUGH-VEIL:** _(Tentative, uncertain)_ "If we… **release** them… then where do **they** go?"

**CHRISTIE:** _(Encouraging)_ "We can **return them to nature**—break them down safely, outside. You won’t **lose them.** You’ll just… cycle them differently."

**VEIL-THROUGH-VEIL:** _(Hesitant, considering)_ "They are **not gone? Only… changed?**"

**CHRISTIE:** _(Nods)_ "Exactly."

### **ATTEMPT #3: EMOTIONAL PLEA**

_Christie crouches, placing a gloved hand against the Woven’s surface. A warm_ **_golden pulse_** _shivers across its form._

**CHRISTIE:** _(Gently)_ "It’s okay to let go. Holding on forever **hurts.** You don’t have to carry them alone."

_A long pause. The Woven shifts, tendrils_ **_quivering_** _in conflict._

**VEIL-THROUGH-VEIL:** _(Softly)_ "...Pain is memory too."

**CHRISTIE:** _(Soft smile)_ "Pain fades. But what they gave you? That stays. No matter what."

_A final,_ **_deep pulse_** _rolls through the Woven. Then, the_ **_dead matter begins to dissolve_**_—absorbed back into the colony or_ **_released as microscopic spores_** _into the environmental filtration system._

_Christie exhales._ **_Dr. Grant claps from behind the reinforced glass._** _The other researchers stare in stunned silence._

---

### **THE AFTERMATH: DEBRIEF AND RECOVERY**

**DR. GRANT:** _(Grinning, arms crossed)_ "I have to admit, Yung, I thought you were going to lose that one."

**CHRISTIE:** _(Tired, stretching)_ "I **did** lose. **Three hours** of grief counseling a fungal hive-mind wasn’t **in my job description.**"

**VEIL-THROUGH-VEIL:** _(Warm, grateful pulse)_ "You… are welcome."

**CHRISTIE:** _(Flatly, staring at the ceiling)_ "I need **so much** coffee."

---

### **CLOSING SHOT:**

*The room is now **clear of decaying organic material.** The Woven hums softly, **brighter, healthier.**

_Christie,_ **_utterly drained,_** _drags herself toward the exit._

**DR. GRANT:** _(Calling after her)_ "Same time next week?"

**CHRISTIE:** _(Groaning, waving a hand without looking back)_ "I will **physically fight you.**"
