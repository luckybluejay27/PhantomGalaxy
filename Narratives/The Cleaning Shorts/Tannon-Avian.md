### **SCENE: RESEARCH STATION CLEANING BAY**

*A large, sterile facility with reinforced flooring. A standard hygiene station has been repurposed into a battlefield. **Ka’Rika**, a towering Tannon Avian with **golden-orange plumage and a razor-sharp beak**, perches on a reinforced steel table. Her **massive wings are half-unfurled**, shedding a **constant, infuriating stream of down and dander.**

_Ben, standing before her, looks at the_ **_four destroyed vacuum cleaners_** _lying in various stages of death around the room._

---

### **ATTEMPT #1: BASIC VACUUMING**

**BEN:** _(Excited, holding a heavy-duty industrial vacuum)_ "Alright, Ka’Rika, just stay still and let the machine do its work. Easy-peasy."

**KA’RIKA:** _(Ruffling her feathers, curious)_ "If this is a human ritual, I will allow it."

**Ben switches on the vacuum.**

*The moment the nozzle touches Ka’Rika’s wing, **a feather gets sucked in, promptly jamming the motor.** The vacuum shrieks in protest, emits smoke, and then **explodes in a small shower of sparks.**

*Ben blinks. Ka’Rika **tilts her head.**

**KA’RIKA:** _(Calmly)_ "Was that supposed to happen?"

**BEN:** _(Slowly, deadpan)_ "...No."

### **ATTEMPT #2: UPGRADED VACUUM**

_Ben wheels out a_ **_reinforced military-grade vacuum._** _This one is_ **_bigger, stronger, and equipped with a self-cleaning motor._** _He looks determined._

**BEN:** _(Muttering to himself)_ "Alright, you winged menace, let’s see you take down **Big Suck.**"

**Ka’Rika** watches with mild interest.

*Ben flicks the switch. The vacuum **roars to life.** He presses the nozzle to Ka’Rika’s **chest feathers**—**BIG MISTAKE.**

*A **whirlwind of down and molted fluff** is instantly pulled into the machine. The vacuum’s canister fills **instantaneously,** the motor starts **howling,** and with a final **ka-CHUNK**, it **bursts into flames.**

*Ka’Rika **jumps slightly**, not from fear, but from sheer **amazement.**

**KA’RIKA:** _(Delighted)_ "Your machines are fragile! This is fun!"

**BEN:** _(Screaming internally)_ "NOT FOR ME!"

### **ATTEMPT #3: SCIENCE VS. VACUUM**

**Dr. Grant** leans in from the observation window, sipping coffee.

**DR. GRANT:** _(Amused)_ "Ben, have you considered **not using a vacuum?**"

**BEN:** _(Feral at this point)_ "OH, YOU THINK I HAVEN’T THOUGHT OF THAT?!"

*Ben hauls out the final vacuum. It’s **the last one they have in stock.**

*Ka’Rika **stretches her wings** casually. Another **avalanche of loose feathers** flutters to the ground.

**Ben stares at them.**

**BEN:** _(Dead inside)_ "I hate physics."

---

### **ATTEMPT #4: THE SACRIFICIAL FINAL VACUUM**

*Ben **grabs the largest vacuum**, a machine that could easily **suck a bowling ball through a straw.**

*He turns it on.

*He does not touch Ka’Rika.

*The mere presence of her **feathers being airborne** overwhelms the intake. The vacuum begins **whining** in despair. Ben barely has time to react before:

**KABOOM.**

*The final vacuum **detonates.**

**A deafening silence follows.**

*Ben **slowly looks up, soot-covered.** Ka’Rika sits on the table, **completely unfazed.**

### **THE AFTERMATH: LESSONS LEARNED**

**DR. GRANT:** _(Laughing openly now)_ "Ben, why didn’t you just dunk her in a **hydrogen peroxide bath**? That would’ve done the trick."

**BEN:** _(In disbelief, trembling slightly)_ "…Peroxide… doesn’t hurt them?"

**KA’RIKA:** _(Smugly ruffling her feathers)_ "We do not absorb it. It simply… dissolves the filth. Very efficient."

*Ben **collapses to his knees.** He has waged war against vacuum technology, and **he has lost.**

*Ka’Rika flicks a feather off her shoulder, then stands and **steps into the peroxide tub, relaxing instantly.**

**BEN:** _(Whispers, completely broken)_ "I could have just… dunked you…"

**DR. GRANT:** _(Wiping away a tear from laughing)_ "Oh, buddy. I hope we get **more birds in next week.**"

---

### **CLOSING SHOT:**

_Ben silently drags the remains of the_ **_four_** _ruined vacuums to the disposal chute, staring blankly into the void._

**KA’RIKA:** _(Stretching her wings in the bath, sighing in pleasure)_ "Humans are **so** dramatic."
