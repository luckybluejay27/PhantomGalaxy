### **SCENE: ARCHON MAINTENANCE BAY**

*A pristine, sterile laboratory gleams under clinical white lighting. **Dr. Valerie Nadir** enters in **a full biohazard suit**, complete with sealed gloves, a filtration mask, and **disinfectant sprayers attached to her wrists.**

*She is **armed for bacterial armageddon.**

*Sitting on a reinforced **diagnostic chair** is **A-71, aka "Aster"**, a humanoid **Synth** with a sleek **black-and-chrome chassis.** Their **internal systems hum softly**, running through **self-check procedures.**

---

### **ATTEMPT #1: THE DRAMATIC ENTRANCE**

**DR. NADIR:** _(Adjusting mask, activating wrist sprayers)_ "Alright, let’s begin decontamination. Hold still."

**ASTER:** _(Pauses self-diagnostics, looking up)_ "Decontamination…?"

**DR. GRANT:** _(Leaning into the intercom, already amused)_ "Oh boy."

_Nadir presses a button. A fine_ **_mist of high-grade disinfectant_** _sprays over Aster’s chassis._

_Nothing happens. Obviously._

**ASTER:** _(Flatly)_ "I do not have **organic material** susceptible to microbial degradation."

**DR. NADIR:** _(Not listening, scrubbing feverishly at an already polished shoulder plate)_ "Bacteria **can** survive on metal. I have **studies.**"

**ASTER:** _(Patiently)_ "I am equipped with **self-sanitizing nanoparticle plating.** My surfaces remain at **near-sterile conditions at all times.**"

**DR. NADIR:** _(Freezes, mid-scrub)_ "...Oh."

**DR. GRANT:** _(Sipping coffee, enjoying this immensely)_ "Told you."

---

### **ATTEMPT #2: SEARCHING FOR PURPOSE**

_Dr. Nadir stands_ **_awkwardly_**_, still holding a cloth drenched in medical-grade ethanol._

**DR. NADIR:** _(Hesitant)_ "So… what exactly **do** I do?"

*Aster **tilts their head**, blinking in a deliberate, **calculating manner.**

**ASTER:** _(Calmly)_ "I require new **processing cores** installed. My current system is running an optimization cycle."

_Nadir blinks._*

**DR. NADIR:** _(Uncertain)_ "...That’s it? I just—hand you parts?"

**ASTER:** _(Nods, expression neutral)_ "Correct."

*Dr. Nadir **looks down at her suit**, the **antimicrobial arsenal strapped to her body,** the **sanitation-grade tools she meticulously sterilized.**

Then she looks at the **simple toolkit** labeled **"Replacement Cores."**

**DR. NADIR:** _(In disbelief)_ "I trained for **three years** in xenopathogenic biohazard containment."

**DR. GRANT:** _(Trying not to laugh)_ "And now you’re an **intergalactic parts delivery service.**"

---

### **ATTEMPT #3: ACCEPTING HER FATE**

_Nadir,_ **_now deflated_**_, sighs and picks up a_ **_small memory core._** _She hands it to Aster._

*Aster, without looking, **installs it directly into their processing slot.**

*A **soft hum** runs through their frame as **optimization protocols refresh.**

*Dr. Nadir slowly **hands over each part**, watching as Aster **effortlessly upgrades their own systems** like an automatic **disk defrag.**

---

### **THE AFTERMATH: UNFULFILLED EXPECTATIONS**

**DR. NADIR:** _(Flat, staring at the now-pristine lab)_ "So… that was it?"

**ASTER:** _(Running final checks)_ "Efficiency rating: **Optimal.** Task complete."

_Nadir_ **_removes her mask_**_, looking mildly betrayed by the simplicity of it all._

**DR. GRANT:** _(Cheerfully patting her shoulder)_ "Look on the bright side, Doc. At least your **vacuum didn’t explode.**"

_Nadir stares blankly at the ground as laughter erupts from the other researchers._

---

### **CLOSING SHOT:**

*Dr. Nadir **slowly unstraps** her **sanitation arsenal**, **dejectedly placing them on a table.** Aster **calmly stands, fully optimized, already moving on.**

_Dr. Grant,_ **_grinning,_** _heads toward the exit._

**DR. GRANT:** _(Over his shoulder)_ "I’ll make sure your next assignment has **actual microbes.** Maybe."

**DR. NADIR:** _(Weakly, glaring after him)_ "I **will** disinfect your entire office."
