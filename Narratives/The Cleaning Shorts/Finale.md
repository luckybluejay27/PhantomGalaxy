### **SCENE: COMMON LOUNGE, RESEARCH STATION**

_A cozy, well-lit breakroom filled with_ **_humans and their alien counterparts_**_, all gathered around a central table. In front of each person is a_ **_bowl of ice cream_**_—a_ **_treat from Earth_** _that has been deemed an essential cultural experience._

### **PART 1: TEAM REVIEW OVER ICE CREAM**

**ANGIE:** _(stabbing aggressively at her ice cream)_ "Scrubbing a **Tannon** was the worst experience of my life. The **tools broke.** The **industrial tools broke.** And I ended up **just towel-dabbing his head like a disappointed mom.**"

**RUK’THAR:** _(Shrugs, casually enjoying his bowl of plain vanilla)_ "It was… acceptable."

**BEN:** _(dead inside, staring at his spoon)_ "Four vacuums. **Four.** **Ka’Rika shed so much I violated the Geneva Convention.**"

**KA’RIKA:** _(cheerfully crunching through frozen blueberries, unfazed)_ "Your tools were **weak.**"

**CHRISTIE:** _(groaning, head in hands)_ "I played therapist for a **fungal hive-mind.** I convinced it to **let go of its dead.**"

**VEIL-THROUGH-VEIL:** _(pulsing warmly, voice overlapping)_ "We feel… **lighter.** We thank you."

**MICHAEL:** _(tired, picking webbing out of his hair)_ "I was **almost** the reason for an explosion. Never set Juvian silk on fire. Ever."

**S’KIRIIN:** _(calmly consuming pistachio ice cream)_ "Your restraint was noted. And appreciated."

**VALERIE:** _(still bitter, spooning chocolate ice cream into her mouth aggressively)_ "I trained **three years** for biological warfare. And I spent **two hours handing parts to a glorified computer.**"

**ASTER:** _(blinking slowly, monotone)_ "I have achieved **optimal efficiency.** Thank you."

### **PART 2: SPECIES REACTIONS TO ICE CREAM**

- **Tannon Saurian (Ruk’Thar):** Enjoys vanilla. Claims it is "acceptable fuel."
    
- **Tannon Avian (Ka’Rika):** Loves frozen berries. **Refuses dairy.**
    
- **Juvian (S’Kiriin):** Enjoys pistachio, but is confused as to why it must be **cold.**
    
- **Woven (Veil-Through-Veil):** Pulses contentedly. Possibly experiences "flavor" through chemical absorption?
    
- **Synth (Aster):** **Does not eat.** Watches curiously.
    
- **Dr. Grant:** Absolutely loving this.

### **PART 3: HOT DOG HAZARD**

**BEN:** _(grinning, pulling a hot dog from a wrapper)_ "Okay. Listen. **Ruk’Thar’s** scales are basically **heat vents.** Sooooo…"

**ANGIE:** _(realizing in horror)_ "No."

**BEN:** _(placing the hot dog carefully on Ruk’Thar’s_ **_neck ridge_**_, watching it sizzle)_ "YES."

*Ruk’Thar, mid-spoonful of ice cream, **pauses.** He glances down at the hot dog. A thin **wisp of smoke** curls up. The air **begins to smell like cooking meat.**

**MICHAEL:** _(slowly backing up)_ "I am **so** out of here."

*Then—**flames.**

**Ruk’Thar’s automatic heat flush activates. The hot dog immediately **bursts into flame.** The researchers **scatter.**

**DR. GRANT:** _(laughing hysterically, from a safe distance)_ "I was **waiting for this!**"

**KA’RIKA:** _(delighted, clapping her claws together)_ "MORE FIRE!"

*Veil-Through-Veil pulses in what might be laughter. Michael **grabs a fire extinguisher** and **Ben runs for his life.** Ruk’Thar just **shrugs and goes back to his ice cream.**

### **CLOSING SHOT:**

_A slightly_ **_charred_** _but_ **_still-intact_** _hot dog sits in the center of the table._*

**BEN:** _(panting, covered in foam, looking at the wreckage of his plan)_ "...Totally worth it."

**RUK’THAR:** _(popping the burnt hot dog into his mouth, chewing thoughtfully)_ "Hmmm. **Acceptable fuel.**"
